- **UI:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **AI:** OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Database:** InstantDB (real-time)
- **Build:** Turborepo + pnpm
- **Deploy:** Vercel

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- OpenAI API key
- InstantDB account (free tier works)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trentbrew/servimatt-assessment.git
   cd servimatt-assessment/app-v1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create `apps/web/.env.local`:

   ```env
   # OpenAI
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

   # InstantDB (create a free app at instantdb.com)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANTDB_ID=your_app_id
   INSTANTDB_ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_token
   ```

   > **💡 For Reviewers/Recruiters:**
   > The live demo is fully functional at [servimatt.brew.build](https://servimatt.brew.build).
   > If you'd like to run locally, you can use the demo InstantDB app:
   >
   > ```env
   > NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANTDB_ID=8357e015-af13-4615-ac4c-b0be9d2a8832
   > ```
   >
   > You'll still need your own OpenAI API key. The admin secret is not needed for read-only testing.

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open the application**
   ```
   http://localhost:1290
   ```

## 📚 Usage

### Creating a Custom Agent

1. Click the **"+ New Agent"** button in the sidebar
2. Configure the agent:
   - Name and expertise area
   - Personality traits
   - Visual identity (icon & color)
   - Optional: Custom system prompt
3. Click **"Create Agent"**
4. Your agent appears in the icon rail

### Starting a Chat

1. Select an agent from the sidebar
2. Click **"+ New"** to create a chat thread
3. Type your message or upload files
4. The agent responds with streaming text

### Using RAG with Files

1. Click the **📎 paperclip icon** in the chat input
2. Select files (CSV, JSON, MD, XLSX, TXT)
3. Ask questions about the uploaded content
4. The AI analyzes and responds with insights

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### OpenAI Agents SDK Integration

- Custom agent creation with `Agent.create()`
- Tool integration for specialized functions
- Handoff system for multi-agent orchestration
- Streaming support for real-time responses

### RAG Implementation

```typescript
// File parsing with content extraction
const parsed = await parseFileContent(fileId, filename, type);

// Context-enhanced prompt generation
const enhancedPrompt = createContextPrompt(files, userQuery);

// Agent execution with file context
const result = await run(agent, enhancedPrompt, { stream: true });
```

### Real-Time Data Flow

```
User Action → API Route → InstantDB → Real-time Update → UI Re-render
```

### Security Considerations

- API keys are server-side only (never exposed to client)
- File validation (type, size, content)
- Admin SDK for secure file operations
- Content truncation to prevent token overflow
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

---

## 📖 API Routes

### `POST /api/agent`

Execute AI agent with optional file attachments

- **Body:** `{ message, fileAttachments?, stream?, agent? }`
- **Returns:** Streaming response or JSON

### `POST /api/upload/files`

Upload files to InstantDB storage

- **Body:** FormData with files and chatId
- **Returns:** `{ success, files, errors? }`

### `POST /api/upload/avatar`

Upload agent avatar image

- **Body:** FormData with avatar file
- **Returns:** `{ fileId }`

---

## 🧪 Testing
